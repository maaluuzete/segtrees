# Segment Trees Library

This repository contains a collection of Segment Tree implementations in C++ for learning and competitive programming purposes. I created this library for fun while exploring different types of segment trees and tree-based data structures.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maaluuzete/segtrees.git
cd segtrees
```
### 2. Include the header files in your C++ project:
```
#include "segtrees/lazytree.hpp"
#include "segtrees/nodetree.hpp"
// code
```
